# Recomendation_engine_movies_db
Letâ€™s say we want to study movie preference of users, and we have an access to the movie ratings for each of these individual users.

We can create an algorithm to cluster out people and base on the average rating inside the cluster, we give a recommendation on which movie they should watch.

We use k-means clustering algorithm, and basic sql with pandas to solve this problem.

The data we'll be using comes from the wonderful [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) [user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Packages used:
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-Learn
